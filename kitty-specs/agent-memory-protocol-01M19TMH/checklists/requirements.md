# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Memory Protocol

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-08-30  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, and C-### entries
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification treats signed memory as an attributable claim, not truth,
  authorization, or prompt instruction.
- Memory streams are independently selectable from collaboration histories so
  volume or hostile content cannot become a prerequisite for code review.
- The operational self-hosting alpha is an explicit implementation dependency,
  allowing this mission to be fully specified now without competing for its
  foundational identity and replication boundaries.
